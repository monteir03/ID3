# Inductive Decision Tree (ID3)
2022/2023
Artificial Intelligence
Work by Mafalda Aires and Gon√ßalo Monteiro

## Requirements

You need the following files to run this code: DataFrame.py, id3.py, main.py, Node.py, predict.py, TestFrame.py. The data files should be in the .csv format. All these files should be in the same directory.

## How to execute

To learn the model and print the Decision Tree, you only need to run the following command in your terminal:
"python3 main.py train_set.csv" (where "train_set" is the name of your file)

If you want to use the model to make predictions, you need to add a second file(the test file)
without the target labels. 
The command should be as follows:
"python3 main.py train_set.csv test_set.csv"w
With this command, the decision tree will still appear.
